# 1: the default locations for access and error logs => access_log error_log 
# 2: configure asynchronous I/O for file operations => aio sendfile direction
# 3: the serverâ€™s statuses when errors occur => error_page
# 4: configure compression => gzip gzip_disable
# 5: fine-tune the TCP keep alive settings => keepalive_disable keepalive_requests keepalive_timeout
# 6: rules that Nginx will follow to try to optimize packets and system calls => sendfile tcp_nodelay tcp_nopush
# 7: directives configure an application-level document root and index files => root index
# 8: various hash tables that are used to store different types of data : *_hash_bucket_size *_hash_max_size for server_names, types, variables

# contexts

# the server context is declared within the http context

# you can declate multiple server contexts,  because each instance defines a specific virtual server to handle client requests. You can have as many server blocks as you need, each of which can handle a specific subset of connections.

# first server context

# This context type is also the first that Nginx must use to select an algorithm
